DESCRIPTION:

./somestufftotest is a directory that contains the files test1.txt, test2.txt and test3.txt
	test1.txt -> check basic functionality of the code
	test2.txt -> check how the program handles symbols and other null spaces ('\t', '\n', '\s')
        test3.txt -> same as test1.txt but all in caps. Should return JSD of 0.0
        test4.txt -> if the file is empty

	./shows is a directory that contains subdirectories ./strangerThings and ./criminalMinds which contain the files story1.txt, 
	cast1.txt and story2.txt, cast2.txt respectively
		./strangerThings
			story1.txt -> text file
			cast1.txt -> text file
		./criminalMinds
			story2.txt -> text file
			cast2.txt -> text file 
The purpose of accessing ./shows is to check if the program accesses sub-directories and files without running into any errors.
